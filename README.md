# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project builds a **supervised learning model** to predict diabetes using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**. It applies multiple machine learning techniques, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of different models while optimizing accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- **Source:** [Dataset Link](https://github.com/Lokeshkonga3/analyzing-pima-indian-diabetes-dataset-/blob/main/diabetes.csv)
- **Features:** Includes medical attributes like glucose level, BMI, age, insulin levels, etc.

## Installation & Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries before running the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
