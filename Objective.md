"The objective of this project is to build a supervised learning model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. I implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to analyze patient data and determine whether they might have diabetes based on features like glucose levels, BMI, and insulin levels."
