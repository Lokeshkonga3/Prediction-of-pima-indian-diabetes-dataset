# Diabetes Prediction Model 🏥🔬

## Objective 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to **build a machine learning model** that predicts diabetes based on patient health indicators. It utilizes **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest** to classify whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. This project aims to:
- **Provide insights** into key health factors related to diabetes.
- **Develop an accurate classification model** using supervised learning.
- **Apply data preprocessing techniques** for model optimization.
- **Evaluate multiple ML algorithms** to compare performance.
